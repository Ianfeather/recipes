- Dev experience - live reload
- Regular DB Backups
- Containerise? Manage orchestration with db somehow.

- Make the RDS instance non-public
- being able to just paste in 7 recipe urls would be cool
- should move the go api to an ec2 server or non-netlify serverless fn


# infra

Ok it's setup with a proxy service so is now reachable on a serverless function.

Things I've done manually
-- secrets (for db connection - added them directly in the lambda console)
-- connect to DB - it's behind a vpc but console configured
-- api gateway + routes setup

# todo
-- need cloudformation to manage all of the resources
-- need a deployment pipeline
-- need to be able to query/migrate data on RDS - seems like moving it to aurora is the answer there
-- be able to toggle between lambda and regular api locally

# done
-- cors setup
-- move bigshop to use the new api
-- updated character set
