- Regular DB Backups
- Containerise? Manage orchestration with db somehow.

Ok it's setup with a proxy service so is now reachable on a serverless function. All being configured manually so far through the console :(

It still can't connect to a DB - but i haven't given it perms to be fair. Next steps:
-- secrets
-- role to connect to DB
-- cloudformation to manage all of this
