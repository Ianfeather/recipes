# todo
- need a deployment pipeline
- need cloudformation to manage all of the resources
- not sure how to query/migrate data on RDS
- be able to toggle between lambda and regular api locally
- Dev experience - live reload
- being able to just paste in 7 recipe urls would be cool


## Done, but configured manually (via console)
- secrets (for db connection - added them directly in the lambda console)
- connect to DB - it's behind a vpc but console configured
- api gateway + routes setup
